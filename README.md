# Mythoystrike Backend

## Overview

This repository contains the backend development of the Mythoystrike project. Mythoystrike is built using the Java programming language and Java Spring Boot framework.

## Interfaces

Communication with the frontend is facilitated through two main interfaces:

- **Websocket:** Real-time bidirectional communication between the backend and the frontend.
- **REST:** Representational State Transfer for stateless communication between the backend and the frontend.

## Testing

To ensure code quality and validity, both unit tests and integration tests have been implemented.
